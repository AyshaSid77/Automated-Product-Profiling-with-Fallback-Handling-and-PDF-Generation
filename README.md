**Automated Product Profiling with Fallback Handling and PDF Generation**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on building a Product Profile Portfolio for a set of consumer products. Each profile includes standardized and structured product details, such as:

1.Product name and brand

2.SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)

3.Ingredients and allergens

4.Nutritional information

5.Packaging format

6.Naming conventions

The portfolio is designed to serve as a reference document for product management, compliance, and distribution purposes.

**Objective**
To create a clean, consistent, and accurate set of product profiles from a raw dataset. The raw input contains incomplete or unclear information, requiring data enrichment, formatting, and validation.

**Tasks and Challenges**
1.Standardizing data formats across different suppliers

2.Interpreting and expanding incomplete or coded product descriptions

3.Researching missing data using external sources

4.Applying a consistent naming and packaging framework

5.Delivering outputs in professional formats (PDF and presentation)

**Implementation Details**

**Components Used**

**Component	Description**

**input.csv	Contains raw product data:** Product ID, Description, and Supplier
PRODUCT_DATABASE	A Python dictionary holding complete specifications for known products
Fallback System	Logic to handle missing data using default values or prompts for manual input

**Workflow Summary**

**Read Input:** Parse the input.csv to extract product fields

**Match Data:** Compare entries with PRODUCT_DATABASE for known specs

**Enrich Data:** Use fallback system or external research to fill gaps

**Standardize Output:** Apply naming and packaging conventions

Generate PDF: Export structured product profiles into a formatted PDF

Prepare Presentation: Summarize approach, challenges, and key learnings
